# The isolation of the slices, checked on the real dependency graph —
# installed by `harness init-repo`; the repository owns it from here.
#
#   bash scripts/isolation.sh
#
# What the architecture asks (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, principle 5, rules 2
# and 3): the world of reading is parallelisable because no slice knows
# another. So, on the graph `cargo metadata` answers — not on the text of a
# Cargo.toml, which misses a workspace-level dependency and a transitive one:
#
# 1. A Capability (crates/<system>/capabilities/<name>/) or a DataCapability
#    (crates/<system>/data-capabilities/<name>/) depends on no other
#    Capability or DataCapability, directly or transitively.
# 2. It depends only on crates of its own system (crates/<system>/…),
#    never on another system's. A DataCapability's system is the DataGuard's.
# 3. A crate shared inside a system — one that a Capability or a
#    DataCapability depends on — depends on no Capability, no DataCapability
#    and no crate of another system: plumbing, never a bridge.
#
# And code is shared through a crate or not at all: no `#[path]`,
# `include!` or `include_str!` that leaves a slice's folder, no symlink
# inside one. Shared *meaning* is a Concept with its fixtures, not a crate.
#
# Exits 1 on the first rule broken, every break printed as a CI annotation.
